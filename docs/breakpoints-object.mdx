## Breakpoints object

The `breakpoints` object is a mandatory requirement and must be passed to the theme. It is used to set the media query keys and corresponding breakpoint widths that will be utilized by the `generatedProps`, `mq`, and `variations` functions.

The `breakpoints` object should have the following structure:

```typescript
{
  [key: string]: number;
}
```

The keys represent the media query labels or names, while the values are the corresponding breakpoint widths. The widths should be specified as `number` values, and the units applied will be `em`.

By providing the `breakpoints` object in the theme, you enable the library's functions to utilize these defined breakpoints for responsive styling and other related operations.

Please ensure that you pass the `breakpoints` object to the theme, adhering to the specified structure and data type requirements.

```javascript title="breakpoints.js"
export const breakpoints = {
  lg: 76, // 1216px
  md: 64, // 1024px
  sm: 48, // 768px
  xs: 0
}
```
