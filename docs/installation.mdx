## Dependencies

There are no strict peer dependencies for this library. It has been specifically tested with styled-components, but it should also work properly with other CSS-in-JS libraries like emotion that provide a theme provider with a theme object passed into each styled component (components that interpret string template functions).

## Instalation

```bash title="yarn"
yarn install styled-gen
```

```bash title="npm"
npm install styled-gen
```
